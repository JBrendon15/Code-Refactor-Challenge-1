## Description

For this project, we were given a working application with a lot of repeating code. We had to refactor the code so that the code was not repetitive. We also had to change some of the tags to semantic tags. We did this by changing classes in the code that had the same styling in CSS into one class. We changed some of the div tags that had classes assigned to header, figure, footer, etc. We learned that DRY coding affects efficiency when loading on a browser. So grouping multiple classes into one will help efficiency.
